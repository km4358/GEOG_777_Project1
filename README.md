# WisconsinWater
tkinter application

This map is another project from my Capstone in GIS Development course at UW-Madison. We were tasked with developing a standalone application that would perform spatial analysis on water wells and cancer occurrences in the state of Wisconsin. I chose to create a Python based application utilizing a Tkinter GUI. Arcpy code is used for running the spatial analysis, which in this case was Inverse Distance Weighted and Ordinary Least Squares. Once the analysis is completed, the application allows the user to toggle between the resulting analysis maps.
